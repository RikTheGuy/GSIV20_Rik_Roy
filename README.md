## Key Features

### Straight and Simple

The project is made with simplicity in mind. Every component has its own tests and styles so that it/they may be reused in different applications directly.
The Reducers are kept fairly straight forward envisioning the changes that may occur in the future.

## Future Additions

### Styling

The Project can be turned into a proper production application with a few visual changes and assigning proper themes to it.

### Integration Tests

Integration Tests may be added for the screens themselves to check how well the components used work with each other.
